# Excel-Basics
This is my first capstone project provided by Sparta under the **Essential Excel Skills for Data Preparation and Analysis** course. I conducted a survey focusing on the proportion of time individuals spend commuting from home to work each day. From this survey, I formulated a hypothesis suggesting that a significant number of Filipino employees in Metro Manila face regular traffic congestion, leading to extended commute durations and heightened stress levels.
